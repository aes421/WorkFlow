# WorkFlow

A visually pleasing Pomodoro Technique App written for FitBit Versa.  Learn more about the Pomodoro Technique using [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
The user will complete a set of 4 sprints, with the first 3 followed by a short break and the last followed by a longer break.  The length of each session is configurable through the FitBit mobile app.  A countdown timer is shown with an aesthetic circular progress bar surrounding it.  The background can be changed by swiping near the top of the screen.  The current time is visible in the top right corner to not negate the purpose of the watch.
